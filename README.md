Web Scraping Example (BeautifulSoup)

## Overview
This is a simple Python project that scrapes **local news headlines** using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.  
The example uses the [IOL South Africa News](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa) page, but you can replace the URL with any local site of interest.
